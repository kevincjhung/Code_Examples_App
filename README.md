# Code Snippets App

This is a code snippets app that allows users to create code snippets and share them with other users. Users can also comment on code snippets and like code snippets. This app is built with Next.js, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS.

It is extended from a project in the course javascript frameworks.

## 1) Prisma

✅ Setup all of the models and relationships for the entities in the README file.

## 2) Create a post

✅ Add a button to the home page that says "Create a post" and takes you to a page where you can create a post.

✅ When the user submits a post, it should send the data to the server and create a new post in the database.
    - Currently, it redirects to the homepage, make it redirect to the page of the code snippet after that page is built

## 3) Get all posts on the home page

✅ When the user goes to the home page, it should fetch all of the posts from the database and display them on the page.

✅ We're going to assume that the posts are constantly changing and could take a while to load, so instead of doing SSR for the list of posts, do the following:

✅ When the page loads, show a loading indicator

✅ use swr, or useEffect to fetch the posts over an AJAX request and display them on the home page.

## 4) View a single post and comments

✅ When a user clicks on a single post, it should take them to a page that shows the post and all of the comments for that post.

✅ use getStaticProps to load the post

✅ use swr, or useEffect to fetch the comments for the post.

## 5) Create a comment

✅ Allow a user to create a new comment on a post. This will increment the comment count for that post.
    - the state updates but the number above the icon does not

## 6) Like/Unlike post

❌✅  Allow a user to like and unlike a post. This will increment or decrement the like count for that post.
      Clicking the like button will toggle the like on and off.

## 7) User Profile Page

✅ Create a profile page at /profile that shows the user's posts and comments.<br><br>
<br><br>

## 8) Add user auth (lab)

<b>Add user auth to the app using next auth.</b>

✅ 15% Add github login

❌ 15% Add google login (probably leave this until the end)
    Google Auth
    <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/>

    Create the consent screen

    http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google

✅ 15% Add the user auth nav bar functionality: Show the avatar in the nav bar
    Allow the user to sign out from the nav bar
    Allow the user to sign in from the nav bar

✅ 15% Don't allow a user to create a post unless they are logged in.

✅ 15% Create a logical flow for a user to sign in and then create a post.
    (restrict access to the create post page, or have them sign in when they hit the submit button)

✅ 15% Save the logged in user to the database using the prisma adapter

✅ 10% Create a one-to-many relatioinship between the user and the other entities:
